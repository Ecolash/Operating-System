/*
ðŸ”’ Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)
   A mutex is used to ensure exclusive access to a shared resource. 
   It is ideal when:

  - Protecting shared data: When multiple threads read/write shared data, a mutex ensures only one thread can modify it at a time.
  - Critical sections: Use a mutex to guard critical code regions where data inconsistency may arise.
  - Simple synchronization: Ideal when one thread performs a task and others must wait for it to finish.

ðŸ”„ Condition Variables
   A condition variable is used for thread communication, especially when a thread must wait for a condition to become true. 
   It is ideal when:

  - Thread waiting: When a thread needs to wait until a certain condition is met (e.g., data availability, queue not empty).
  - Signaling: Useful when one thread produces data (producer) and another thread consumes it (consumer).
  - Complex synchronization: Preferred when multiple threads must coordinate under specific conditions.
