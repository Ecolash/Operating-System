/*
Condition Variables in POSIX Threads (pthread)

-----------------------------------------------
1. Creating/Destroying a Condition Variable:
-----------------------------------------------
- pthread_cond_init() - Initializes a condition variable.
- pthread_cond_t cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER; - Static initializer for condition variables.
- pthread_cond_destroy() - Destroys a condition variable when no longer needed.

-----------------------------------------------
2. Waiting on a Condition:
-----------------------------------------------
- pthread_cond_wait() - Causes a thread to wait on a condition variable.
   - Must be called only after locking a mutex.
   - Unlocks the mutex while waiting and locks it again once awakened.

- pthread_cond_timedwait() - Same as pthread_cond_wait() but with a timeout.

-----------------------------------------------
3. Waking Threads Based on Conditions:
-----------------------------------------------
- pthread_cond_signal() - Wakes one thread waiting on the specified condition.
- pthread_cond_broadcast() - Wakes all threads waiting on the specified condition.

-----------------------------------------------
4. Important Notes:
-----------------------------------------------
- Always pair a condition variable with a mutex to avoid race conditions.
- Ensure proper locking before calling pthread_cond_wait() to avoid deadlocks.
- Use pthread_cond_broadcast() if multiple threads are waiting on the condition.
- Always check the condition in a loop after pthread_cond_wait() to avoid spurious wakeups.

/*
Condition Variables are used when a thread must wait for a condition to become true before proceeding.

ðŸ”¹ Condition Variable Functions;

    pthread_cond_init() â€” Initializes the condition variable.
    pthread_cond_wait() â€” Waits until a condition is signaled.
    pthread_cond_signal() â€” Wakes one waiting thread.
    pthread_cond_broadcast() â€” Wakes all waiting threads.
    pthread_cond_destroy() â€” Destroys the condition variable.

ðŸ”¹ Usage:
   - pthread_cond_init(&condition_cond, NULL);              // Initialize the condition variable
   - pthread_cond_wait(&condition_cond, &condition_mutex);  // Wait for the condition
   - pthread_cond_signal(&condition_cond);                  // Signal one waiting thread
   - pthread_cond_broadcast(&condition_cond);               // Signal all waiting threads
   - pthread_cond_destroy(&condition_cond);                 // Destroy the condition variable
